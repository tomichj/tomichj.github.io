### Hello! I'm Justin Tomich.

I'm a web developer at a Fortune 50 company, and co-founder of a startup: [engage-cpa.com]. I design and build web applications. This site is new, but I'm hoping to cover a mixture of software and infrastructure that will allow you to build beautiful, maintainable web-based applications.

You can find me on [twitter].

Check out my current open-source projects [here] or on [github]. Most of my open source packages are lessons and components extracted from [engage-cpa.com].
